# BJ Portfolio

## What This Is

A personal developer portfolio website for Belwin Julian, designed to showcase software/web app projects, present professional background, and provide resume access. Built with a dark, polished aesthetic inspired by craftz.dog — targeting recruiters and hiring managers.

## Core Value

Recruiters can quickly see who Belwin is, what he's built, and download his resume — all in a visually impressive, fast-loading experience.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Dark-themed portfolio with polished, subtle animations (fade-ins, hover effects, smooth transitions)
- [ ] Hero/landing section with name, title, and brief intro
- [ ] About me section with bio, background, and skills
- [ ] Projects showcase displaying software/web apps with descriptions, tech used, and links
- [ ] Resume page with on-page display and downloadable PDF
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Deployed on Vercel
- [ ] Frosted-glass navigation bar inspired by craftz.dog
- [ ] Fast loading and SEO-friendly

### Out of Scope

- Blog/posts section — not needed for job hunting focus
- Light theme / theme toggle — dark only for now
- Contact form — link to email/LinkedIn sufficient for v1
- CMS or admin panel — content managed in code
- OAuth or user accounts — static portfolio, no auth needed

## Context

- Inspired by Takuya Matsuyama's portfolio (craftz.dog): dark theme, minimalist design, frosted-glass nav, smooth animations, clean project cards
- Primary audience: recruiters and hiring managers in software engineering
- Projects are software/web applications Belwin has built
- Resume needs to be both viewable on-page and downloadable as PDF
- No blog content planned — focus is on projects and professional presentation

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: Vercel — free tier, fast deploys
- **Aesthetic**: Dark theme only, inspired by craftz.dog's visual language
- **Animation**: Subtle and tasteful — no overwhelming motion

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dark theme only (no toggle) | Cleaner implementation, matches desired aesthetic | — Pending |
| No blog section | Job hunting focus — projects and resume matter more | — Pending |
| Vercel deployment | Free tier, excellent performance, easy CI/CD | — Pending |
| Resume: on-page + PDF download | Maximum accessibility for recruiters | — Pending |
