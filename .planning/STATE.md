## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dark theme only (no toggle) — Cleaner implementation, matches desired aesthetic
- No blog section — Job hunting focus, projects and resume matter more
- Vercel deployment — Free tier, excellent performance, easy CI/CD
- Resume: on-page + PDF download — Maximum accessibility for recruiters
- Manual Next.js scaffolding (01-01) — create-next-app prevented scaffolding into existing directory; manually created identical structure
- Forced dark mode with next-themes (01-01) — forcedTheme and enableSystem=false ensure dark-only mode
