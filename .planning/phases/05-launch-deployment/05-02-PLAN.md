<objective>
Deploy the portfolio to Vercel production and verify everything works live -- social previews, analytics, cross-device rendering.

Purpose: The portfolio must be publicly accessible for recruiters. This is the final step that makes all prior work visible to the world. Vercel deployment is the locked decision from project planning.
Output: Live production URL, verified social previews, confirmed analytics tracking.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Deploy to Vercel Production</name>
  <files>
    .gitignore
  </files>
  <action>
    First, ensure all changes from Plan 01 are committed and pushed to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git status
    git push origin main
    ```

    Ensure .gitignore includes lighthouse artifacts:
    - Add `lighthouse-report.json` and `lighthouse-report.html` to .gitignore if not already present.

    Deploy to Vercel using the CLI:
    ```bash
    npx vercel --yes
    ```
    This creates a preview deployment. If it succeeds, promote to production:
    ```bash
    npx vercel --prod --yes
    ```

    If the Vercel CLI is not authenticated, it will prompt for login -- follow the auth flow. If auth fails, create a checkpoint for the user to authenticate manually via `npx vercel login`.

    After deployment completes, capture the production URL from the CLI output.

    Verify the deployment:
    1. Curl the production URL to confirm it returns 200: `curl -sI <PRODUCTION_URL> | head -5`
    2. Check that the HTML includes the og:image meta tag: `curl -s <PRODUCTION_URL> | grep -i "og:image"`
    3. Check that the Analytics script is present: `curl -s <PRODUCTION_URL> | grep -i "vercel"`

    If the user wants to add a custom domain later, they can do so via Vercel Dashboard -> Project -> Settings -> Domains. Document this in the SUMMARY.

    Enable Vercel Analytics in the dashboard (note: @vercel/analytics package is already installed, but Analytics must also be enabled in the Vercel project dashboard for data to flow).
  </action>
  <verify>
    Production URL returns HTTP 200.
    HTML source includes og:title, og:description, og:image meta tags.
    Page renders correctly (not a blank page or error).
    `npm run build` still succeeds locally.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Portfolio is live on Vercel production URL. Deployment succeeds without errors. Production URL returns 200 with correct HTML content including OG metadata.
  </done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Verify Live Site -- Cross-Device, Social Previews, Analytics</name>
  <files>none (verification only)</files>
  <action>
    Human verification of deployed production site. The portfolio is now deployed to production on Vercel with all accessibility improvements from Plan 01 live, analytics tracking configured, and OG metadata set for social sharing. User must verify the following on real devices and browsers.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Visit the production URL on phone and desktop browser -- all sections render (Hero, About, Projects, Resume, Contact/Footer)
    2. Navigation links scroll to correct sections, hamburger menu works on mobile
    3. Press Tab repeatedly on desktop -- every interactive element shows visible focus ring, skip-to-content link appears first
    4. Paste production URL into https://www.opengraph.xyz/ -- preview shows correct title, description, and OG image
    5. Visit Vercel Dashboard -> Project -> Analytics -- confirm Analytics is enabled and page views appear after visiting the live site
    6. Click project demo links on live site -- confirm they open correctly (placeholder URLs expected to be broken until user adds real project URLs)
  </verify>
  <done>
    User has confirmed: site renders correctly on mobile and desktop, keyboard navigation works with visible focus indicators, social media preview displays correctly, analytics tracking is active, and navigation functions properly on the live production URL.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. Production URL is live and returns HTTP 200
2. All sections render correctly on production
3. OG meta tags present in page source
4. Social media preview shows correct title, description, and image
5. Keyboard navigation works on live site
6. Analytics dashboard shows page views after visiting
7. Site renders correctly on mobile and desktop viewports

<success_criteria>
- Portfolio is deployed and publicly accessible on Vercel
- Social media previews display correctly when URL is shared
- Analytics tracking is active and recording visits
- Site works on mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px+) viewports
- All navigation and interactive elements function correctly on production
- User has confirmed live site looks correct (human-verify checkpoint)
</success_criteria>
