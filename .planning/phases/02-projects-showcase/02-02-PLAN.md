<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Projects section, wire into page, and add reduced-motion CSS</name>
  <files>components/Projects.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
1. Create `components/Projects.tsx`:
   - Import `projects` from `@/lib/projects-data`
   - Import `ProjectCard` from `@/components/ProjectCard`
   - Render a `<section>` with `id="projects"` and `className="min-h-screen py-20 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 scroll-mt-20"`
   - Inner container: `max-w-6xl mx-auto`
   - Header area (`mb-12`):
     - `<h2>` with text "Projects" — `text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4`
     - `<p>` with subtitle — `text-lg text-muted max-w-2xl` — Text: "A selection of projects showcasing full-stack development, clean architecture, and modern web technologies."
   - Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8`
   - Map over `projects` array rendering `<ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />`
   - Export named: `export function Projects()`

2. Update `app/page.tsx`:
   - Add import: `import { Projects } from '@/components/Projects'`
   - Replace the placeholder `<section id="projects" ...>` block with `<Projects />`
   - Keep all other placeholder sections (about, resume, contact) as they are

3. Update `app/globals.css` — Add reduced-motion CSS AFTER the existing `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block. Replace the existing block with a comprehensive one:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     html {
       scroll-behavior: auto;
     }
     *,
     *::before,
     *::after {
       animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
       transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       scroll-behavior: auto !important;
     }
   }
   ```
   This disables hover scale transitions, card lift effects, and image zoom animations for motion-sensitive users.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no type errors. Run `npm run build` to verify the page builds successfully. Check:
- components/Projects.tsx exists and exports Projects
- app/page.tsx imports and renders Projects (no more projects placeholder section)
- app/globals.css has the comprehensive prefers-reduced-motion block
  </verify>
  <done>Projects section renders responsive grid of ProjectCards on the landing page, reduced-motion CSS protects motion-sensitive users, navigation scroll-to-projects still works</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify projects showcase visually</name>
  <files>none (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Present the completed projects showcase for human verification. Claude automated:
- 3 project cards in responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- Optimized images via next/image with fill, sizes, lazy loading
- Hover effects (card lift, image zoom) and focus states on links
- Tech stack pills, demo/GitHub links on each card
- prefers-reduced-motion CSS for accessibility

Verification steps for user:
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
2. Scroll down to the Projects section (or click "Projects" in navigation)
3. Verify you see 3 project cards in a grid layout
4. On desktop (1024px+): cards should display in 3 columns
5. Resize browser to tablet width (~768px): cards should switch to 2 columns
6. Resize to mobile width (~375px): cards should stack to 1 column
7. Hover over a card: card should lift slightly with shadow, image should zoom slightly
8. Each card should show: image, title, description, tech stack pills, Live Demo link, GitHub link
9. Click "Live Demo" and "GitHub" links: they should open in new tabs (URLs are placeholders, that is expected)
10. Tab through cards with keyboard: focus rings should be visible on links
  </action>
  <verify>Human confirms visual appearance matches expectations by typing "approved"</verify>
  <done>Projects showcase visually verified: responsive grid, hover/focus effects, accessible interactions, all card content visible</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
2. `npm run build` completes without errors
3. Projects section visible on landing page at http://localhost:3000
4. Responsive grid: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop
5. Navigation "Projects" link scrolls to projects section
6. Hover and focus states work on cards and links
7. prefers-reduced-motion CSS present in globals.css
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Projects section renders 3 cards in responsive grid on landing page
- Grid adapts correctly: 1 column (mobile) -> 2 columns (tablet) -> 3 columns (desktop)
- Each card shows image, title, description, tech stack pills, and links
- Hover effects (card lift, image zoom) are smooth
- Focus states visible on keyboard navigation
- prefers-reduced-motion disables animations
- Navigation smooth-scrolls to projects section
- Human verification approved
</success_criteria>
