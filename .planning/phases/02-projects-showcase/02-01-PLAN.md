<objective>
Create the project data model, populate with 3 placeholder projects, generate placeholder images, and build the ProjectCard component with optimized images and accessible interactions.

Purpose: Establishes the data layer and reusable card component needed for the projects showcase grid.
Output: Type definition, project data array, 3 placeholder images, and a fully styled ProjectCard component.

  <name>Task 1: Create project type, data array, and placeholder images</name>
  <files>types/project.ts, lib/projects-data.ts, public/projects/placeholder-1.webp, public/projects/placeholder-2.webp, public/projects/placeholder-3.webp</files>

1. Create `types/project.ts` with the Project interface:
   - id: string
   - title: string
   - description: string
   - image: StaticImageData (imported from 'next/image')
   - techStack: string[]
   - demoUrl: string
   - githubUrl: string

2. Create `public/projects/` directory. Generate 3 placeholder WebP images (800x450, 16:9 aspect ratio) using a simple canvas approach. Use Node.js to create minimal valid WebP files, or use ImageMagick/convert if available. If neither is available, create simple colored rectangle PNG files and name them with .webp extension (Next.js image component handles format conversion). The images should be at least ~1KB each so they are valid image files. Colors: dark blue (#1e3a5f), dark purple (#3b1f5e), dark teal (#1a4f4f) to match dark theme.

3. Create `lib/projects-data.ts` with a typed array of 3 projects using static imports for images:
   - Project 1: "Portfolio Website" - "Personal developer portfolio built with Next.js, featuring dark theme, responsive design, and optimized performance." - techStack: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS"] - demoUrl: "https://belwinjulian.dev" - githubUrl: "https://github.com/belwinjulian/portfolio"
   - Project 2: "Task Management App" - "Full-stack task management application with real-time updates, drag-and-drop organization, and team collaboration features." - techStack: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB", "Socket.io"] - demoUrl: "https://taskflow-demo.vercel.app" - githubUrl: "https://github.com/belwinjulian/taskflow"
   - Project 3: "Weather Dashboard" - "Interactive weather dashboard with location-based forecasts, animated visualizations, and severe weather alerts." - techStack: ["React", "TypeScript", "OpenWeather API", "Chart.js"] - demoUrl: "https://weather-dash-demo.vercel.app" - githubUrl: "https://github.com/belwinjulian/weather-dashboard"

Note: These are placeholder projects. Belwin will replace with real project data later. The structure and functionality matter now.

Import images using static imports: `import placeholder1 from '@/public/projects/placeholder-1.webp'`
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm type definitions compile without errors. Verify files exist:
- types/project.ts exports Project interface
- lib/projects-data.ts exports projects array with 3 entries
- public/projects/ contains 3 image files
  </verify>
  <done>Project type interface defined with all required fields, 3 placeholder projects in typed array, 3 placeholder images exist in public/projects/</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create ProjectCard component with optimized images and accessibility</name>
  <files>components/ProjectCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `components/ProjectCard.tsx` as a React component accepting a Project prop.

Structure using semantic `<article>` element with these sections:

1. **Image container**: `relative aspect-video overflow-hidden rounded-t-lg` parent div. Use `next/image` with:
   - `fill` prop
   - `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"`
   - `className="object-cover transition-transform duration-300 group-hover:scale-105"`
   - Descriptive alt text: `` `Screenshot of ${project.title}` ``

2. **Content section** (`p-6`):
   - `<h3>` with project title (text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-foreground)
   - `<p>` with description (text-muted mb-4, line-clamp-3 for consistent card height)
   - Tech stack pills: flex flex-wrap gap-2 mb-4, each pill `px-3 py-1 text-sm bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full`, with `aria-label="Technologies used"` on container
   - Links row: flex gap-4, two `<a>` elements for "Live Demo" and "GitHub"

3. **Card styling**: `group rounded-lg border border-border bg-card overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-primary/5 hover:-translate-y-1`

4. **Accessibility**:
   - All links: `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
   - Links: pair `hover:underline` with `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-background rounded`
   - Screen reader text on links: `<span className="sr-only"> of {project.title}</span>` and `<span className="sr-only"> repository for {project.title}</span>`
   - Tech stack container: `aria-label="Technologies used"`

Use the existing theme tokens from globals.css (text-foreground, text-muted, bg-card, border-border, text-primary, bg-primary/10).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm ProjectCard compiles without type errors. Verify the component:
- Imports Image from next/image and Project from types/project
- Uses article element
- Has fill, sizes props on Image
- Has hover: paired with focus: on links
- Has sr-only spans for accessibility
  </verify>
  <done>ProjectCard component renders project image with next/image optimization, displays title/description/tech-stack/links, has accessible hover+focus states, and uses semantic article markup</done>
</task>

<verification>
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
2. All 6 files exist: types/project.ts, lib/projects-data.ts, components/ProjectCard.tsx, public/projects/placeholder-{1,2,3}.webp
3. Project interface has all 7 fields (id, title, description, image, techStack, demoUrl, githubUrl)
4. projects array has exactly 3 entries
5. ProjectCard uses next/image with fill and sizes props
6. Links have both hover and focus states
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Project type definition compiles and exports correctly
- 3 placeholder projects with all required fields exist in data array
- 3 placeholder images exist in public/projects/
- ProjectCard component renders image, title, description, tech stack pills, and links
- Image uses next/image with fill, sizes, and lazy loading
- All interactive elements have paired hover/focus states
- TypeScript compiles with no errors
</success_criteria>
