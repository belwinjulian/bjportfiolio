<objective>
Enhance hover effects on all interactive elements, add Hero entrance animation, and verify Lighthouse Performance score stays 90+ after all animation work.

Purpose: This plan completes the polish layer by adding micro-interactions (PLSH-02, PLSH-03) and verifying performance (TECH-02). Hover effects make the site feel responsive and alive. The Hero entrance creates a strong first impression. Lighthouse verification ensures animations don't degrade load performance.

Output: Enhanced interactive elements, Hero entrance animation, verified 90+ Lighthouse score.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Hero entrance animation and enhance hover effects on all interactive elements</name>
  <files>components/Hero.tsx, components/ProjectCard.tsx, components/Navigation.tsx, components/Footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. **Hero entrance animation** (`components/Hero.tsx`):
   - Keep Hero as a server component (no 'use client' needed) — use pure CSS animation
   - Add the `animate-fade-in-up` class (from globals.css, created in plan 04-01) to the inner `<div>` containing all Hero content
   - Add a short animation delay stagger to create a cascading effect:
     - Greeting ("Hello, I'm"): no delay, `animate-fade-in-up` with inline `style={{ animationDelay: '0ms' }}`
     - Name (h1): `style={{ animationDelay: '100ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}`
     - Professional title: `style={{ animationDelay: '200ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}`
     - Value proposition paragraph: `style={{ animationDelay: '300ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}`
     - CTA buttons div: `style={{ animationDelay: '400ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}`
   - Each element gets `animate-fade-in-up` class AND its own delay
   - Use `animationFillMode: 'backwards'` so elements are invisible before their delay starts
   - Keep animation short: the keyframe is 0.7s, total cascade completes in ~1.1s
   - This is within acceptable LCP range since it's a CSS animation, not blocking JS

2. **Enhanced ProjectCard hover effects** (`components/ProjectCard.tsx`):
   - The card already has `hover:-translate-y-1` and `hover:shadow-lg` — enhance these:
     - Change `hover:-translate-y-1` to `hover:-translate-y-2` (slightly more lift)
     - Add `hover:border-primary/30` for a subtle border color shift on hover
   - The image already has `group-hover:scale-105` — this is good, keep it
   - Enhance the "Live Demo" and "GitHub" links:
     - Add `transition-all duration-200` (replace just `hover:underline`)
     - Add `hover:text-primary/80` for subtle color shift
     - Keep the existing focus styles
   - Add `will-change-transform` class to the article element (hint for GPU layer on hover)
   - All hover properties are GPU-accelerated: transform (translate-y, scale) and opacity — no layout properties

3. **Enhanced Navigation hover effects** (`components/Navigation.tsx`):
   - Desktop nav links already have `hover:text-foreground transition-colors duration-200`
   - Add subtle underline effect: add `relative` class and a pseudo-element approach via Tailwind:
     - Add `after:absolute after:bottom-0 after:left-0 after:h-0.5 after:w-0 after:bg-primary after:transition-all after:duration-200 hover:after:w-full` to desktop nav links
     - This creates an expanding underline from left to right on hover
   - Logo/name link: already has `hover:text-primary transition-colors` — add `hover:scale-105 transition-all` for subtle scale effect
   - Mobile links: keep simple `hover:text-foreground` — mobile doesn't need complex hover effects

4. **Enhanced Footer hover effects** (`components/Footer.tsx`):
   - Social links already have `hover:text-foreground transition-colors`
   - Enhance with: `hover:text-primary` instead of `hover:text-foreground` (match primary color used elsewhere)
   - Add `transition-all duration-200` (upgrade from just transition-colors)
   - Add subtle scale: `hover:scale-105 origin-center` for a micro-interaction feel
  </action>
  <verify>
   - `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
   - `components/Hero.tsx` has animate-fade-in-up on individual content elements with staggered animationDelay
   - `components/ProjectCard.tsx` has hover:-translate-y-2, hover:border-primary/30, will-change-transform
   - `components/Navigation.tsx` desktop links have expanding underline pseudo-element classes
   - `components/Footer.tsx` social links have hover:text-primary and hover:scale-105
   - No layout-triggering properties (width, height, top, left, margin, padding) used in any hover effect
  </verify>
  <done>Hero has staggered entrance animation (5 elements cascading over ~1.1s). Project cards have enhanced lift, border glow, and link hover effects. Navigation links have expanding underline animation. Footer links have primary color and scale hover effects. All animations use GPU-accelerated properties only. Build passes.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Run production Lighthouse audit and fix any performance issues</name>
  <files>components/Hero.tsx, components/ProjectCard.tsx, components/Navigation.tsx, components/Footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Build production version and test:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Verify build completes successfully and note bundle sizes from build output.

2. Check that First Load JS is under 100KB (the target for 90+ performance). If build output shows larger bundles, investigate with:
   ```bash
   npx next build --debug
   ```

3. Verify that `react-intersection-observer` is not being loaded on initial page load when it's only needed for below-fold sections. Since AnimatedSection is 'use client' and used inside section components, Next.js should code-split it appropriately.

4. Check for any performance red flags in the build output:
   - Large page sizes (> 200KB first load)
   - Missing static optimization
   - Unexpected client-side bundles

5. If any performance issues found:
   - If bundle too large: check if react-intersection-observer is tree-shaken properly
   - If First Load JS exceeds 100KB: consider lazy loading AnimatedSection with next/dynamic
   - If static pages became dynamic: ensure no unnecessary 'use client' propagation to page.tsx

6. Run a basic verification that the dev server starts without errors:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3099 &
   sleep 5
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3099
   kill %1 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Expect HTTP 200.

Note: Full Lighthouse CLI testing requires Chrome/Puppeteer which may not be available in this environment. The key verification is that the production build succeeds with reasonable bundle sizes (First Load JS < 100KB) — this strongly correlates with 90+ Lighthouse Performance. The executor should note build output sizes in the summary. If Lighthouse CLI IS available (`npx lighthouse`), run it against the production server.
  </action>
  <verify>
   - `npm run build` succeeds without errors
   - Build output shows First Load JS reasonably sized (target: under 100KB)
   - Dev server starts and responds with HTTP 200
   - No unexpected 'use client' propagation to page.tsx (page.tsx should remain a server component)
  </verify>
  <done>Production build succeeds with acceptable bundle sizes. First Load JS is within target range for Lighthouse 90+ Performance score. No performance regressions from animation additions. Dev server starts and serves pages correctly.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` completes without errors — bundle sizes noted
2. `npm run dev` — verify on page load:
   - Hero content cascades in with staggered fade-in animation
   - Hover over nav links — expanding underline appears smoothly
   - Hover over project cards — card lifts higher, border glows, image scales
   - Hover over Hero CTA buttons — smooth color transition
   - Hover over footer social links — color changes to primary, slight scale
3. Toggle prefers-reduced-motion in DevTools — all animations and transitions become instant
4. First Load JS in build output is under 100KB (strongly correlates with Lighthouse 90+)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Hero entrance animation plays on page load with staggered cascade effect
- All interactive elements (nav links, buttons, project cards, footer links) have smooth hover feedback
- All hover effects use only GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Production build succeeds with First Load JS under 100KB
- prefers-reduced-motion respected on all new animations and transitions
- No layout-triggering CSS properties animated anywhere
